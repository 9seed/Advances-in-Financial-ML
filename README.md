Machine learning (ML) is changing virtually every aspect of our lives. 
Today ML algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert 
humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this is the most 
exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that will transform 
how everyone invests for generations. 

Readers will learn how to 
structure Big data in a way that is amenable to ML algorithms; 
how to conduct research with ML algorithms on that data; how to 
use supercomputing methods; how to backtest your discoveries while 
avoiding false positives. The book addresses real-life problems 
faced by practitioners on a daily basis, and explains scientifically 
sound solutions using math, supported by code and examples. 

Readers become active users who can test the proposed solutions in 
their particular setting. Written by a recognized expert and portfolio 
manager, this book will equip investment professionals with the 
groundbreaking tools needed to succeed in modern finance.
